# Retail Line Monitoring
Using the OpenCV OAK-D camera with ADLINK Edge AI hardware and software to build a solution that counts the number of people waiting in line outside a retail store. The solution uses machine vision to estimate the number of people by doing an intersection between the people detected and a virtual line.
